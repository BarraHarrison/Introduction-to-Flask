# Introduction-to-Flask
This project includes a variety of routes that respond to different URLs.
The routes serve static HTML, dynamic content, and render HTML templates.
It also showcases the use of helper functions to generate content dynamically.

# Features
Basic Routing: Demonstrates simple routes that return static HTML content directly.
Dynamic Routing: Shows how to create routes that take dynamic arguments, such as name, age, and product_id.
Template Rendering: Uses Flaskâ€™s render_template() function to render HTML pages from the templates directory.
Helper Functions: Includes helper functions like create_title() to dynamically generate HTML content within a route.

/: Introduction page with a simple heading.
/homepage: Renders index.html template.
